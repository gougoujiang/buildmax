# Changelog

All notable changes to BuildMax are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
BuildMax is currently in alpha, so incompatible changes may still occur between
pre-releases and must be called out in release notes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `./make kind status` and `./make compose status`, read-only summaries of the
  two local deployment paths. `kind status` prints the selected cluster and
  context, probes the Portal ingress, and lists nodes plus the Deployments,
  Jobs, and Pods in every namespace `kind up` installs. `compose status` lists
  every service, including exited ones, and probes the server and Portal ports
  on the host. Neither creates, builds, or generates anything, so a stack that
  was never started is distinguishable from an unhealthy one without reading
  full container logs.
- A managed model catalog in the new `llm_model` table, edited with
  `buildmax-server model add|list|enable|disable` on the machine that already
  holds the database credentials. Credentials are read by exactly one query, the
  one that builds a provider client, and never appear in a listing, an API
  response, or an error — but note that database backups now carry provider
  keys. An optional `llm` block in `server.yaml` maps team aliases to catalog
  models, and `conversation.model_target` runs Tier 1 on one. An alias naming a
  model that does not exist fails its own calls rather than stopping the server,
  because the catalog is edited independently of the policy. See
  `docs/design/llm-gateway.md`.
- A managed inference gateway: `GET /api/teams/{team_id}/llm/models` lists the
  aliases a team may use, and `POST /api/teams/{team_id}/llm/completions` runs
  one blocking call against an operator-approved model. Clients name an alias,
  never an endpoint, a credential, or a provider model identifier. Every call is
  recorded in a new `llm_call` ledger — identity, model, timing, outcome, and
  token usage, with no prompts or generated content. No BuildMax client uses the
  gateway yet, and a team already over quota is refused, which is accounting
  rather than a spending ceiling.
- CLI and Desktop can use a deployment's managed models. A `settings.yaml` entry
  with `transport: buildmax`, `server_url`, and `team_id` calls a BuildMax
  server instead of a provider, so no provider key sits on the machine; its
  `model` field is a team alias. The credential comes from `buildmax login` and
  is only sent to the server the login belongs to. `buildmax models` lists every
  configured model and where it sends prompts, and `--team` lists a team's
  aliases. The model picker in the TUI and Desktop names the destination for a
  managed entry, and `buildmax doctor` reports one that cannot authenticate.
  There is no automatic fallback between the two modes, and the login expires
  after 24 hours with no refresh yet. Workers and the evaluation harness stay
  direct.
- Managed calls can stream. `stream: true` answers with typed `delta`, `result`,
  and `error` events over SSE; abandoning the call cancels the provider request
  so it stops costing tokens. A call refused before any output is still a plain
  HTTP error, and one that fails after its first delta reports the failure as an
  error event. Repeating a `call_id` answers `409` naming the original call
  instead of running it twice. A reverse proxy in front of the server needs
  response buffering off for this route.
- A Compose stack under `deployment/compose/`: MySQL, the server, and the
  Portal, with a script that generates the secrets. `docs/deploy/compose.md`
  walks from nothing to a signed-in Portal.
- Single-use login codes. `buildmax-server user create` and
  `buildmax-server user login-code` let an operator create an account and issue
  a per-account, expiring code, which is how a deployment signs people in
  without a mail channel. Codes are stored hashed and redeemed atomically.

- The Portal is published as a container image,
  `ghcr.io/gougoujiang/buildmax-portal`, tagged with the release it was built
  from. A separate workflow builds it, so a frontend failure cannot hold up the
  binaries.
- `BUILDMAX_API_BASE` configures the Portal image's API URL at container start,
  which is what lets one published image serve any deployment.

- `buildmax init` writes a starter `settings.yaml`, optionally with the API key
  supplied on the command line.
- golangci-lint, govulncheck, and `-race` tests in CI, plus CodeQL analysis for
  Go and TypeScript that starts once the repository is public.
- ESLint for the Portal and desktop frontends, with `npm run lint` in each.
- Open source governance, support, maintainer, and conduct policies.
- Markdown, npm production license, configuration example, Git history secret
  scanning, and release snapshot checks in CI.
- SPDX SBOM generation, GitHub artifact attestations, and release image
  vulnerability scanning.
- Native Linux, macOS, and Windows release archive smoke checks, including
  checksum and required-content validation.
- A public launch checklist and documented issue triage policy.

- Contributor on-ramp documents: `docs/contribute/first-pr.md` walks clone to
  pull request, and `docs/contribute/conventions.md` collects the naming, entity
  ID, tool-output, commit, and changelog rules that review applies. Neither the
  build, the tests, the lint, nor the deployment smokes need a model API key —
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` now says so instead of listing one as a prerequisite.
- `.gitattributes` and `.editorconfig`, so line endings and editor defaults match
  what the toolchains already enforce, and the language statistics describe the
  project rather than its fixtures.
- `.buildmax/README.md` explains why this repository checks in its own workspace
  agent configuration when `.claude/` and `.vibe/` stay ignored.
- A contributor doctor, scoped `check` tasks, Node/npm/Wails version pins,
  fresh-clone CI, Desktop frontend tests, and an implementation-task issue
  template make both human and agent-assisted contributions reproducible.

### Changed

- Full `./make build` is now strict and includes the Portal; frontend or Wails
  failures no longer leave a successful partial build. Portal and Desktop lint
  are zero-warning gates.
- `AGENTS.md` is now a compact, stable navigation and constraint guide backed
  by integrity tests for the repository's `.buildmax` agent configuration.
- Release chores now live under `./make release`, and local image loading is
  `./make kind images`.

- **Self-registration is closed by default.** `POST /api/otp/request` refuses
  `intent: signup` with 403 unless `server.yaml` sets `allow_signup: true`.
  Together with `dev_login_otp`, open signup meant anyone who could reach a
  server could create an account and then sign in as it.
- The Portal no longer hard-codes a developer's local kind hostname to pick its
  API URL; the kind manifest sets `BUILDMAX_API_BASE` like any other deployment.
- `buildmax version` falls back to the Go build info, so a binary installed with
  `go install` reports its module version instead of `dev`.
- Startup tells a first-time user what to do: a missing configuration file, a
  file without models, and an unedited placeholder key are now three distinct
  messages instead of one.
- Go 1.26.6, `golang.org/x/net` 0.55.0, `golang.org/x/text` 0.39.0, and
  `goldmark` 1.7.17 — closing 23 vulnerabilities reachable from this code.
- Release tools are pinned to exact versions for reproducible builds.
- Release setup instructions now use the current YAML configuration flow.
- The local kind manifests moved from `setup/` to `deployment/dev-kind/`, next to
  the deployment files they resemble. `./make kind up` is unchanged.
- Community health files — Code of Conduct, Support, Governance, Maintainers,
  Trademarks — moved to `.github/`, where GitHub surfaces them exactly as it does
  from the repository root. The root now carries only README, CONTRIBUTING,
  SECURITY, CHANGELOG, ROADMAP, LICENSE, and the agent instructions.
- `AGENTS.md` no longer duplicates the repository tree or detailed project
  conventions. It keeps only a compact command/constraint guide and routes to
  `docs/contribute/repo-layout.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and the new
  `docs/contribute/conventions.md` for the full sources of truth.

### Removed

- Dead code across the agent runtime, storage, handlers, and CLI that the new
  linter surfaced.
